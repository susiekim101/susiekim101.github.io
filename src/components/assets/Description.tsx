        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Hi ðŸ‘‹! </h2>
        <p className="whitespace-pre-line">
            I'm Susie Kim, a rising second-year computer science student passionate about motivating change through technology.
            I love seeing my ideas come to life and watching people interact with the things I build. Programming and designing user-centered
            applications has become both a hobby and a long-term goal I'm eager to scale to larger audiences.
            <br/><br/>
            I thrive in team settings where I can voice ideas and engage in thoughtful discussions. Whether leading a technical team for a 
            nonprofit to implement new backend features or suggesting improvements for UCLA's Evening with Industry, I find energy in collaboration and shared problem-solving.
            <br/><br/>
            I'm also excited about exploring the intersection of AI and robotics, and how intelligent systems can simplify daily tasks, enhance
            human capability, and provide meaningful service in real-world environments. I'm enthusiastic and motivated to contribute to the future
            of robot learning.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">hobbies ðŸŽ§</h2>
        <p>
            While I may not have an extensive list of hobbies, one that has remained constant is dance! I've been dancing (unprofessionally, self taught) since elementary school
            and it has been a healing, creative outlet for me outside of my tech space.
            <br/><br/>
            I generally also love solving puzzles or anything that keeps my mind busy. Out of curiosity, I once represented by school in a Rubrik's cube competition and fell in 
            love with the thrill of trying to finish one in under 40 seconds. Since then, I've pushed myself to solve 4x4 and 5x5 Rubrik's cubes.
