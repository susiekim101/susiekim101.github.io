                        Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Susie Kim, a rising second-year computer science student passionate about motivating change through technology.
                        I love seeing my ideas come to life and watching people interact with the things I build. Programming and designing user-centered
                        applications has become both a hobby and a long-term goal I'm eager to scale to larger audiences.
                        <br/><br/>
                        When I'm not brainstorming or executing new projects, I thrive in team settings where I can voice ideas and engage in thoughtful
                        discussions. Whether leading a technical team for a nonprofit to implement new backend features or suggesting improvements for UCLA's
                        Evening with Industry, I find energy in collaboration and shared problem-solving.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I'm also excited about exploring the intersection of AI and robotics, and how intelligent systems can simplify daily tasks, enhance
                        human capability, and provide meaningful service in real-world environments. I'm enthusiastic and motivated to contribute to the future
                        of robot learning.
                    </p>
